# Waves Authentication & First API Call

This guide shows how to authenticate with the Waves API and make your very first request.

In less than a minute, you'll learn the headers, endpoint, and the sample request/response needed to get started.

---

## Endpoint

`POST https://api.wavesspeech.ai/v1/auth/login`

_(Replace with the actual Waves auth endpoint)_

---

## Required Headers

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY_GOES_HERE>`

  _(Use your API key; do not expose real keys in public docs)_

---

## Sample Request — cURL

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.wavesspeech.ai/v1/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY_GOES_HERE" \
  -d '{
        "email": "your_email@example.com",
        "password": "your_password"
      }'
```

## Sample Request — Python

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.wavesspeech.ai/v1/auth/login"   # Replace with actual endpoint

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
}

payload = {
    "email": "your_email@example.com",
    "password": "your_password"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

## Sample Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR...",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
